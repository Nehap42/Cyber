			<div class="fake-info">
				<span class="sub-heading-1">Fake information</span>
				<p>Fake information is defined as false, misleading, or fabricated content that is presented as true
					or accurate. It may be spread either intentionally (for deception or manipulation) or
					unintentionally (for lack of verification). Examples include fake news, rumors, hoaxes, and
					altered media. It often seeks to misinform, harm reputations, or influence opinions and
					decisions.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="inner-heading">
				<span class="sub-heading">The most common types of fake information used in cyberattacks:</span>
				<div class="points">
					<ul>
						<li><span class="fw-600">Phishing Emails: </span>Impostor emails apparently legitimate to induce
							users to unwittingly divulge
							sensitive
							information; for example, passwords or their financial information.</li>
						<li><span class="fw-600">Fake Websites:</span> Clone sites mirroring trusted platforms to steal
							passwords or spread
							malware.</li>
						<li>Deepfakes Fake videos or recordings of audio clips generated by AIs for mimicry, black
							mail, spreading misinformation.</li>
						<li>Fake Social Media Profiles/posting to breach trust and lead users to impart his personal
							information including money.</li>
						<li><span class="fw-600">Rumor Messages: </span>False warnings or offers (e.g., fake job offers,
							lottery winnings) sent
							via email, SMS, or messaging apps to lure victims.</li>
						<li><span class="fw-600">Fake Software or Updates: </span>
							Malicious software disguised as legitimate apps or updates to gain access to systems or

							manipulate opinions or distract from real cyber incidents.</li>
						<li><span class="fw-600">Spoofed Communication: </span>Falsified emails, caller IDs, or messages
							which appear to come from trusted sources to gain
							trust.</li>
						<li><span class="fw-600">Malvertising: </span>Fake online ads containing malicious links or
							software, often embedded in trusted websites.</li>
					</ul>
					<p> These are methods that exploit human trust and unawareness, hence cybersecurity awareness
						is key. The most common form of fake information used in cyberattacks is phishing, especially
						phishing emails.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="inner-heading">
				<span class="sub-heading">The attacks exploit human trust by:</span>
				<div class="points">
					<ul>
						<li>Masquerading as legitimate organizations or individuals to make users click on Malicious
							links.</li>
						<li>Downloading malware.</li>
						<li>Gives access to sensitive information, for example, passwords, credit card information,
							or personal information.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Phishing is common since it is relatively simple to execute and reaches a wider audience as
						most of the time it uses human error rather than any technical vulnerabilities.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="inner-heading">
				<span class="sub-heading">Dissemination of fake information in the case of cyberattacks stems
					from:</span>
				<div class="points">
					<ul>
						<li><span class="fw-600">Email Services: </span>Cyber phishing mails are forwarded through
							hacked or forged accounts.</li>
						<li><span class="fw-600">Social Media: </span> Spam profiles, messages, posts, and ads are used
							to disseminate false information or links to
							malicious sites.</li>
						<li><span class="fw-600">Messaging Apps: </span>Platforms such as WhatsApp, Telegram, and SMS
							are used to propagate hoaxes, scams, or
							malicious links.</li>
						<li><span class="fw-600">Fake Websites: </span>
							Cloned or fraudulent websites are created to steal credentials or distribute malware.</li>
						<li><span class="fw-600">Online Ads (Malvertising): </span>Malicious advertisements posted on
							genuine websites redirect users to harmful content.</li>
						<li><span class="fw-600">Search Engines: </span>Manipulated SEO techniques promote fake or
							malicious sites so that they could show in search
							results.</li>
						<li><span class="fw-600">File Sharing Sites: </span>Spreading malware embedded in fake software
							or files through cloud storage or torrent sites.</li>

							trusted institutions like banks and government spread
							malicious content.</li>
						<li><span class="fw-600">Dark Web Forums: </span>Fake content, phishing kits, and malware tools
							are shared among cybercriminals to spread
							malware content.</li>
						<li><span class="fw-600">News and Media Sites: </span>Sometimes, fake or manipulated content
							spreads through blogs, websites, or untrusted news
							channels.To counter such, individuals and organizations must always be on guard and check
							their sources before they believe or distribute information.</li>
					</ul>

			<div class="fake-info">
				<span class="sub-heading-1">Cybersecurity Practices</span>
				<p>The main two cyber security practice are:</p>
				<div class="inner-heading">
					<span class="sub-heading">Penetration:</span>
					<div class="points">
						<p>The penetration testing, which is also called pen testing, is the cybersecurity practice of
							testing
							an organization's security measures on a regular basis.
							Purpose: Find vulnerabilities in the systems, networks, or applications of an organization
							that
							attackers may find and exploit them.</p>
						<ul>
							<li><span class="fw-600">Method: </span>Ethical hackers simulate real-life cyberattacks
								against defenses.</li>
							<li><span class="fw-600">Outcome:</span> Give insights into the weaknesses and recommended
								improvements in
								security.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Other related practices include vulnerability assessments and red team exercises, but
							penetration testing focuses on active exploitation of weaknesses.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="inner-heading">
					<span class="sub-heading">Red teaming:</span>
					<div class="points">
						<p>Red teaming is a practice of cybersecurity simulating real-world attacks in order to test the
							effectiveness of an organization's security measures. A red team acts as an adversary by
							using
							tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that are akin to those used by actual
							cybercriminals
							or state-sponsored actors in order to identify vulnerabilities, assess defenses, and
							understand
							how well an organization can detect, respond to, and recover from attacks.</p>
						<p style="font-weight: 600;">
							Key features
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li><span class="fw-600">Simulated Attacks: </span>It simulates a wide range of threats,
								including social engineering,
								physical breaches, network intrusions, and more.</li>
							<li><span class="fw-600">Comprehensive Testing:</span> The red team operates independently
								and can attack any part
								of an organization—systems, people, processes, and physical security.</li>
							<li><span class="fw-600">No Prior Knowledge: </span>Unlike penetration testing, red teams
								usually operate without
								sharing their plans or methodologies with the organization, making it more
								unpredictable.</li>
							<li><span class="fw-600">Collaboration with Blue Team: </span> After the attack simulation,
								the red team shares findings
								with the blue team (the defensive team) to help improve the organization's security
								posture..</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Red teaming offers a more holistic and realistic view of security vulnerabilities and
							response
							effectiveness compared to traditional security assessments.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="inner-heading">
				<span class="sub-heading">Other terms related to cyber security:</span>
				<div class="points">
					<ul>
						<li><span class="fw-600">Vulnerability Scanning: </span>This process of identifying
							vulnerabilities involves automated scanning within a system,
							network, or application to identify known weaknesses or vulnerabilities. It applies special
							tools in scanning and analysis for known security flaws that an attacker may utilize to
							exploit weaknesses in the systems. It therefore discovers security weaknesses and
							vulnerabilities even before attackers exploit them.</li>
						<li><span class="fw-600">Incident Response: </span> Incident response refers to the process of
							detecting, responding to, and recovering from a
							cybersecurity incident or breach. It is aimed at managing the situation in a manner that
							limits
							damage, reduces recovery time, and prevents future incidents. It is the efficient response
							to and
							recovery from cyberattacks or security breaches with the least damage to systems, data, and
							business operations.</li>
						<li><span class="fw-600">Messaging Apps: </span>Platforms such as WhatsApp, Telegram, and SMS
							are used to propagate hoaxes, scams, or
							malicious links.</li>

					modification, or destruction. It encompasses the entire lifecycle of an application, from its design
					and development to deployment and beyond. The primary goal is to ensure the confidentiality,
					integrity, and availability of the application and its data.</p>
					<div class="inner-heading">
						<span class="sub-heading">Common types of application vulnerabilities:</span>
						<div class="points">
							<ul>
								<li><span class="fw-600">Injection flaws: </span>
									These occur when user input is not properly validated or sanitized,
									allowing attackers to inject malicious code (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting
									(XSS)).</li>
								<li><span class="fw-600">Broken authentication and session management: </span>Weak or improperly
									implemented
									authentication and session management mechanisms can be exploited to gain
									unauthorized access to user accounts or sensitive data.</li>
								<li><span class="fw-600">Cross-site scripting (XSS): </span>
									Attackers inject malicious scripts into web pages, which can
									then be executed by unsuspecting users, allowing the attacker to steal cookies, hijack
									sessions, or redirect users to malicious websites.</li>
								<li><span class="fw-600">Broken access control: </span>Improper access controls can allow
									unauthorized users to
									access restricted functionality or data.</li>
								<li><span class="fw-600">Security misconfiguration: </span>
