				<div class="fake-info">
					Fake information
					<p>Fake information is defined as false, misleading, or fabricated content that is presented as true
						or accurate. It may be spread either intentionally (for deception or manipulation) or
						unintentionally (for lack of verification). Examples include fake news, rumors, hoaxes, and
						altered media. It often seeks to misinform, harm reputations, or influence opinions and
						decisions.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="inner-heading">
					The most common types of fake information used in cyberattacks:
					<div class="points">
						<ul>
							<li><span class="fw-600">Phishing Emails: </span>Impostor emails apparently legitimate to induce users to unwittingly divulge
								sensitive
								information; for example, passwords or their financial information.</li>
							<li><span class="fw-600">Fake Websites:</span> Clone sites mirroring trusted platforms to steal passwords or spread
								malware.</li>
							<li>Deepfakes Fake videos or recordings of audio clips generated by AIs for mimicry, black
								mail, spreading misinformation</li>
							<li>Fake Social Media Profiles/posting to breach trust and lead users to impart his personal
								information including money.</li>
							<li><span class="fw-600">Rumor Messages: </span>False warnings or offers (e.g., fake job offers, lottery winnings) sent
								via email, SMS, or messaging apps to lure victims.</li>
							<li><span class="fw-600">Fake Software or Updates: </span>
								Malicious software disguised as legitimate apps or updates to gain access to systems or data.</li>
							<li><span class="fw-600">Spear Phishing: </span>Targeted attacks using fake, personalized information to deceive specific individuals or
								organizations</li>
								<li ><span class="fw-600">Fake News or Misinformation: </span>Fabricated stories spread to manipulate opinions or distract from real cyber incidents.</li>
								<li><span class="fw-600">Spoofed Communication: </span>Falsified emails, caller IDs, or messages which appear to come from trusted sources to gain
									trust</li>
									<li><span class="fw-600">Malvertising: </span>Fake online ads containing malicious links or software, often embedded in trusted websites.</li>
						</ul>
				<p>		These are methods that exploit human trust and unawareness, hence cybersecurity awareness
					is key. The most common form of fake information used in cyberattacks is phishing, especially
					phishing emails.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="inner-heading">
					The attacks exploit human trust by:
					<div class="points">
						<ul>
							<li>Masquerading as legitimate organizations or individuals to make users click on Malicious
								links.</li>
							<li>Downloading malware.</li>
							<li>Gives access to sensitive information, for example, passwords, credit card information,
								or personal information</li>
						</ul>
				<p>Phishing is common since it is relatively simple to execute and reaches a wider audience as
					most of the time it uses human error rather than any technical vulnerabilities.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="inner-heading">
					Dissemination of fake information in the case of cyberattacks stems from:
					<div class="points">
						<ul>
							<li><span class="fw-600">Email Services: </span>Cyber phishing mails are forwarded through hacked or forged accounts.</li>
							<li><span class="fw-600">Social Media: </span> Spam profiles, messages, posts, and ads are used to disseminate false information or links to
								malicious sites.</li>
							<li><span class="fw-600">Messaging Apps: </span>Platforms such as WhatsApp, Telegram, and SMS are used to propagate hoaxes, scams, or
								malicious links.</li>
							<li><span class="fw-600">Fake Websites: </span>
								Cloned or fraudulent websites are created to steal credentials or distribute malware.</li>
							<li><span class="fw-600">Online Ads (Malvertising): </span>Malicious advertisements posted on genuine websites redirect users to harmful content.</li>
								<li ><span class="fw-600">Search Engines: </span>Manipulated SEO techniques promote fake or malicious sites so that they could show in search
									results.</li>
								<li><span class="fw-600">File Sharing Sites: </span>Spreading malware embedded in fake software or files through cloud storage or torrent sites.</li>
									<li><span class="fw-600">Spoofed Communication Channels: </span>False emails, SMS, or calls from trusted institutions like banks and government spread
										malicious content.</li>
										<li><span class="fw-600">Dark Web Forums: </span>Fake content, phishing kits, and malware tools are shared among cybercriminals to spread
											malware content.</li>
											<li><span class="fw-600">News and Media Sites: </span>Sometimes, fake or manipulated content spreads through blogs, websites, or untrusted news
												channels.To counter such, individuals and organizations must always be on guard and check
												their sources before they believe or distribute information.</li>
						</ul>

					Cybersecurity Practices
					<p>The main two cyber security practice are:</p>
					<div class="inner-heading">
						Penetration:
						<div class="points">
							<p>The penetration testing, which is also called pen testing, is the cybersecurity practice of testing
								an organization's security measures on a regular basis.
								Purpose: Find vulnerabilities in the systems, networks, or applications of an organization that
								attackers may find and exploit them.</p>
							<ul>
								<li><span class="fw-600">Method: </span>Ethical hackers simulate real-life cyberattacks against defenses.</li>
								<li><span class="fw-600">Outcome:</span> Give insights into the weaknesses and recommended improvements in
									security.</li>				
							</ul>
					<p>Other related practices include vulnerability assessments and red team exercises, but
						penetration testing focuses on active exploitation of weaknesses</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="inner-heading">
						Red teaming:
						<div class="points">
							<p>Red teaming is a practice of cybersecurity simulating real-world attacks in order to test the
								effectiveness of an organization's security measures. A red team acts as an adversary by using
								tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that are akin to those used by actual cybercriminals
								or state-sponsored actors in order to identify vulnerabilities, assess defenses, and understand
								how well an organization can detect, respond to, and recover from attacks.</p>
								<p style="font-weight: 600;">
									Key features
								</p>
							<ul>
								<li><span class="fw-600">Simulated Attacks: </span>It simulates a wide range of threats, including social engineering,
									physical breaches, network intrusions, and more.</li>
								<li><span class="fw-600">Comprehensive Testing:</span>  The red team operates independently and can attack any part
									of an organization—systems, people, processes, and physical security.</li>
									<li><span class="fw-600">No Prior Knowledge: </span>Unlike penetration testing, red teams usually operate without
										sharing their plans or methodologies with the organization, making it more unpredictable.</li>
									<li><span class="fw-600">Collaboration with Blue Team: </span>  After the attack simulation, the red team shares findings
										with the blue team (the defensive team) to help improve the organization's security
										posture..</li>				
							</ul>
					<p>Red teaming offers a more holistic and realistic view of security vulnerabilities and response
						effectiveness compared to traditional security assessments</p>
						</div>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="inner-heading">
					Other terms related to cyber security:
					<div class="points">
						<ul>
							<li><span class="fw-600">Vulnerability Scanning: </span>This process of identifying vulnerabilities involves automated scanning within a system,
								network, or application to identify known weaknesses or vulnerabilities. It applies special
								tools in scanning and analysis for known security flaws that an attacker may utilize to
								exploit weaknesses in the systems. It therefore discovers security weaknesses and
								vulnerabilities even before attackers exploit them.</li>
							<li><span class="fw-600">Incident Response: </span> Incident response refers to the process of detecting, responding to, and recovering from a
								cybersecurity incident or breach. It is aimed at managing the situation in a manner that limits
								damage, reduces recovery time, and prevents future incidents. It is the efficient response to and
								recovery from cyberattacks or security breaches with the least damage to systems, data, and
								business operations.</li>
							<li><span class="fw-600">Messaging Apps: </span>Platforms such as WhatsApp, Telegram, and SMS are used to propagate hoaxes, scams, or
								malicious links.</li>
